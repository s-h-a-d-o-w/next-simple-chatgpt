# next-simple-chatgpt

A very simple ChatGPT UI that I created because I have trust issues and talk to ChatGPT about all sorts of things. ðŸ˜… (And because one of the popular UI projects here triggered Windows Defender and uses obscure dependencies. I'm using relatively few dependencies that front-end engineers are likely familiar with.)

## Decisions

- No support for attachments because I never discuss images with ChatGPT.
