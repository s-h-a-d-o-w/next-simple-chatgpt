# next-simple-chatgpt

A very simple ChatGPT UI that I created because one can't use the ChatGPT playground on more than 2 or 3 devices at the same time and their captcha implementation has serious accessibility problems. Also, I was skeptical to trust "random" projects on GitHub with my ChatGPT data to begin with and then one of the popular UI projects here uses obscure dependencies and triggered Windows Defender.

I'm using relatively few dependencies that front-end engineers are likely familiar with.

## UX Decisions

- No support for attachments because I never discuss images with ChatGPT.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub oauth app
- ChatGPT API key

## Getting started (dev)

- Clone, install dependencies
- Install `mkcert`
- Run `pnpm create-certificate`
- (Optional: If you want to access the UI from mobile devices on your LAN, I would recommend installing mkcert's CA certificate. Best ask an AI how. ðŸ˜„)
- Create your `.env.local` based on `.env.schema`
- `pnpm dev`
- Ignore Next.js claiming `Network:      http://<IP>:3000` - it's `https`.

## TODO

- Maybe: Make textareas expand in height when very long prompts are being written.

## Dev notes

- Why node scripts for infrastructure tasks? Easy cross-platform compatibility.
- Why HTTPS? Because of `ClipboardItem`. Browsers make an exception for `localhost` but not other devices on the LAN. (To spare others the pain: `nginx` and `http-proxy` don't work. Only the experimental Next.js method. At least with things like server actions and redirects.)
- Auth.js [claims that they can figure out address the user uses](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/deployment#auth_url). But [it actually can't always](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/10928#issuecomment-2247877624). When visiting the server from a different machine on a LAN, `AUTH_URL` has to be set to `http://<IP>:3000/api/auth`.
